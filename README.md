# Commons Stack Membership DApp

#### ðŸ”— https://member.commonsstack.foundation/

The Membership DApp spans three blockchains (Rinkeby, xDAI, and Mainnet) and officially registers you as a legal member of the the Trusted Seedâ€™s Swiss Association!

Opening up formal membership is our first step toward being able to fund both operational activity and member services for our community.

Read more about the benefits of becoming a trusted seed member in [this article](https://medium.com/commonsstack/join-the-commons-stacks-trusted-seed-swiss-association-ed51a356cb6c)! 



## Usage

Our lead developer on this CSdDev project, @sponnet, has given a [full walkthrough on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03HQCF12Qeg) which takes you through all the steps to become a legal member of the Swiss Association.

### 1. Connect

If you have already been accepted into the Trusted Seed, please connect with the same Ethereum address that you used to join. If you have not yet applied to be a member of the Trusted Seed, you will need to do that first.

[ðŸŒ± Apply to become a member of the Trusted Seed](https://commonsstack.org/apply)

### 2. Accept the Statutes and the Terms & Conditions

Accepting and signing with your address is a legal requirement for becoming a member of the Swiss Association.

### 3. Pay your membership dues 

Yearly membership fee is 450 DAI. You can also pay more than 450 :)! By paying more membership dues you will further help the mission of the organization. You can acquire DAI on [1inch.exchange](https://1inch.exchange/#/r/0x8110d1D04ac316fdCACe8f24fD60C86b810AB15A).
